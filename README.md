# CAT-Facial-Analysis-Project
üöÄ Exciting Project Announcement! üöÄ

I am thrilled to share the successful completion of our Cat Facial Analysis Project! This innovative endeavor focuses on predicting facial landmarks on cat images using state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNN) and pre-trained models such as VGG16 and VGG19.

üìä Project Highlights:
Comprehensive Approach: The project involved extensive data preprocessing, model development, training, and evaluation phases.
Robust Dataset: We curated a diverse dataset of cat images with meticulously labeled facial landmark coordinates, ensuring robust model training.
Advanced Models: Leveraged the power of VGG16, VGG19, and a custom CNN model to achieve accurate facial landmark predictions.
High Accuracy: Our CNN model demonstrated outstanding performance, slightly outperforming VGG16 and VGG19 in accuracy.

üîç Key Takeaways:
Preprocessing Excellence: Standardizing and normalizing data significantly improved model performance.
Training Techniques: Employed data augmentation and regularization techniques to enhance model robustness and generalization.
Evaluation Metrics: Focused on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for precise localization of facial landmarks.

üéØ Conclusion:
Our CNN model's superior accuracy underscores the importance of tailored architectures for specific tasks. This project highlights the need for balancing various metrics to achieve optimal performance in facial landmark prediction tasks.
